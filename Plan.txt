Outer boundary cuboid to define build area and starting point of an octree.
Configurable distance threshold `tdist` and feature scale threshold `fsize`.

Split faces at distance points, continuing until either distance is less than tdist, or all faces of the subdivided cuboid are <= fsize for their axis.

Then tetrahedral breakdown of the octree elements that cross zero.
