Outer boundary cuboid to define build area and starting point of an octree.
Configurable distance threshold `tdist` and feature scale threshold `fsize`.

Split faces at distance points, continuing until either distance is less than tdist, or all faces of the subdivided cuboid are <= fsize for their axis.

Then tetrahedral breakdown of the octree elements that cross zero.

Or maybe export the STL file by doing a slice directly on the SDF model -- that might be (?slower) but more able to handle the difference between minimum feature size and positional accuracy.
